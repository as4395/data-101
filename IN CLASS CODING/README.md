Look at section 5.5 power points. There are three derived attribute exercises. 


Submit R code for at least one of them, preferably for all. Make comments explaining your code. You can only use
R101 functions. Subframe, square bracket notation preferred. Use methodology from section 5 - for derived
attributes.

 


It is just practice - not for credit but for participation!
