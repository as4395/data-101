Your task is to predict whether airbnb rental is a good deal, bad deal or just neutral. Airbnb is the Kaggle data set
extended with some features and other features removed. We added square footage and also the rating. We
removed room_type. There are two tables again. The core table (airbnb) and Boroughs table which tells us which
borough the given neighborhood belongs to. 


Data is available in the folder prediction challenges.
