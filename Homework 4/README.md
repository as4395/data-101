You can use the same data set as you selected for HW1. You may also choose to use a different data set. Expand
your article by including results from Bayesian analysis. Do not hesitate to change the title, if better one comes up
as result of the following tasks.


Keep the format of article - just extend the article with more content:


1. Find a pair _observation-belief_ for your data set such that the posterior odds of the belief are at least k times
larger than prior odds of this belief. The larger the _k_, the better (for example, the odds of drama being rated R are
at 2.4 times higher than the odds of any movies being rated R). This can be a good candidate for a good clickbait title. 

2. Build a contingency table T for two categorical variables in your data. For two cells: _T[i, j]_ and _T[k, l]_, calculate the likelihood ratio assuming rows are beliefs and columns are observations (like in the last slide of section 16).
