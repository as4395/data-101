This HW does not involve modifying your article. Just address tasks T1...T4 by submitting commented R code.  
**Use only R101 functions or functions used in active textbook.**


Task 1: Choose a numerical variable (N) and a categorical variable (C) from your dataset. For sample sizes of 1%,
5%, and 50% of your data, calculate the confidence intervals for the mean of N and the proportion of a specific
value of C. Demonstrate how the margins of error change as the sample size increases.

  
Task 2: Set a smaller margin of error (MER) than what you obtained for the 5% sample size in Task 1, for both the
mean and the proportion. Determine the confidence levels that would correspond to these new MER values.
Also, calculate the sample size needed to achieve MER with 90% confidence.


Task 3: Choose two categorical variables (C1 and C2) and select specific values for them (c1 and c2). Extract a 
subset of your data (S). Calculate confidence intervals with a 90% confidence level for the fraction of tuples in S
where C1 equals c1 and C2 equals c2. For example, find the fraction of parties on Saturdays where the DJ is
"Blue" and the music is "Techno."


Task 4: For the numerical variable N, find a subset of your data that includes at least 5% of all data points, where
the confidence interval for the mean of N is the narrowest with a 90% confidence level.
