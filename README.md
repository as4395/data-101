# Data 101

This repository contains the assignments I completed for my Data 101 class.

What you’ll see in this repository:
- Statistical methods including difference of means, p-values, chi-square tests, confidence levels, and multiple hypothesis correction  
- Data wrangling and transformation using the `subset()`, `tapply()`, `table()`, and `aggregate()` functions
- Visual exploration with `plot()`, `barplot()`, `boxplot()`, and `mosaicplot()` 
- Predictive modeling with linear regression and decision trees (`lm`, `rpart`)
- Clearly communicated insights that are relevant to both technical and non-technical audiences
