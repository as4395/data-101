This repository contains the assignments I completed for my Data 101 class.

What you’ll see in this repository:
-  🔍 Statistical methods including difference of means, p-values, chi-square tests, confidence levels, and multiple hypothesis correction  
-  🔧 Data wrangling and transformation using `subset()`, `tapply()`, `table()`, and `aggregate()` 
-  📊 Visual exploration with `plot()`, `barplot()`, `boxplot()`, and `mosaicplot()` 
-  🤖 Predictive modeling with linear regression and decision trees (`lm`, `rpart`), plus validation techniques like cross-validation  
-  🗣️ Clearly communicated insights that are relevant to both technical and non-technical audiences
