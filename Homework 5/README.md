Add at least 1 question (prompts) to it and submit the url of your chat. Do not use prompts like "can you give
another example" etc. Your prompts should seek clarification or may ask for another example with a given
specification. You may ask if Simpson paradox can occur under circumstances you specify. 


If you have the paid version of GPT - submit as many questions as you want related to Simpson paradox.
Remember - never aspire to just bare minimum!
