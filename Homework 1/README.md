# Homework 1

**YOU ARE A DATA JOURNALIST.....**

Write a short article about selected data set. **Make sure that your title is a "clickbait" (exciting, making people to
click) and related to your informal data exploration. Should correspond to a pattern that you discovered in your data.**


Here is more about clickbaits

Select a data set from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets or any other source and import it to your RStudio (do not
use data sets from active textbook). Make sure your data set has a couple of categorical columns and at least one
numerical column. Then explore this data set and find at least three "interesting patterns". Use plots to visualize
(scatter plot, barplot or boxplot). Use subset, table, tapply functions - just as I used in section 3 of active textbook
(section 3.9, 4.6 etc). Show us all of the magic trio R functions (tapply, table, subset) in action. Write at least 10
queries in R and make at least 5 plots. If you unclear what a query is - see the tinyurl.com/RouletteData101 and
check the box for General (and Apply), you can see virtually unlimited supply of examples of queries.


**Make the most interesting pattern into a title of your article.**
**Select the best pattern (your choice) as the title and make other patterns into "alternate" titles**

For example

"The average Airbnb rental in Brooklyn surpasses that in Manhattan by 25%."

"DJ Rohit consistently attracts the largest crowds to his performances."

"The mean IMDb scores of Korean action movies are 50% higher compared to those of U.S.-produced action
movies."

**Then write a short article and make it great and engaging read about exciting findings in the data set which you
selected.**


Submit: R code (as .R file of your code) plus your article in word or pdf with clickbait title and two alternate titles.
Include plots and at least 500 words summary of what you found.

Remember "interesting" is a subjective concept - usually it is

a) Different from your expectations

b) Actionable (you can do something with this information).

Your findings will always be associated with the code (query) which would be a combination of tapply/table, data
subseting and aggregates (mean/min/max). Remember each of your titles has to be associated with a different
pattern - which you found and you can back it up with the plot or R code.

This is why it is important to have your code, explanation why your findings are interesting, and
visualizations/plots.
